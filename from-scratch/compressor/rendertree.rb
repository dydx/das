# This file was used in Destroy All Software production 0102, "Data Compressor
# From Scratch". It wasn't shown in the screencast, so it's not designed to be
# as readable as the main code. All of this code is exactly as used in the
# screencast except for:
#
# - New comments (including this one)
# - The call to `imgcat` was changed to refer to the `imgcat` script in this
#   directory Previously, it relied on the `imgcat` in my ~/bin directory,
#   which is in $PATH.
